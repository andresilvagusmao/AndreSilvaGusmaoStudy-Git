**10 years old definition üë∂**:
- When you want Git to watch a new file or save the changes you made to a file, you have to add it to a special list. This list tells Git which files you want to save in your next project update.

**Definition üßë**:
- Adding files in Git means placing new or modified files into the staging area.This prepares the files to be included in the next commit. The `git add` command is used to add files to the staging area, effectively tracking the changes made to those files.

**PHD definition üéì**:
- In Git, adding files refers to the process of incorporating new or modified files into the staging area, which serves as an intermediary step prior to committing the changes to the repository. The `git add` command is employed to stage files, enabling the tracking of file changes and facilitating selective commits.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**:
1. Create a new file in your Git repository.
2. Add the file to the staging area.
3. Modify an existing file and add it to the staging area.

| ----- | ----------- |
| `.gitignore` | A file that lists files and patterns to be ignored by Git |
| Ignoring specific files or patterns | Specifying files or patterns in `.gitignore` to exclude from tracking |
| Global `.gitignore` | A `.gitignore` file that applies to all Git repositories on the system |

**References üìö**:
- [Git Basics - Recording Changes to the Repository (Ignoring Files section)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring)

**10 years old definition üë∂**:
- Sometimes you don't want Git to save certain files or folders. You can make a list of these files or folders in a special file called `.gitignore`, and Git will ignore them.

**Definition üßë**:
- Ignoring files in Git means excluding specific files or file patterns from being tracked by the version control system. This is achieved by listing the files or patterns in a `.gitignore` file. There can also be a global `.gitignore` file that applies to all Git repositories on the system.

**PHD definition üéì**:
- In Git, ignoring files entails the exclusion of designated files or file patterns from the purview of the version control system. This is achieved by enumerating the files or patterns within a `.gitignore` file, with the option to utilize a global `.gitignore` file that governs all Git repositories on a given system.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**:
1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository.
2. Ignore a specific file by adding its name to the `.gitignore` file.
3. Ignore all files with a specific extension by adding a pattern to the `.gitignore` file.
4. Ignore a specific directory by adding its path to the `.gitignore` file.
5. Set up a global `.gitignore` file that applies to all repositories on your system.

**Answers üëç**:
1. `touch .gitignore`
2. Add the filename to `.gitignore`, e.g., `ignored_file.txt`
3. Add the extension pattern to `.gitignore`, e.g., `*.log`
4. Add the directory path to `.gitignore`, e.g., `ignored_directory/`
5. `git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'` and then edit `~/.gitignore_global` with the desired patterns

**Basic examples üî∞**:

```bash
1. Create a `.gitignore` file: `touch .gitignore`
2. Ignore a specific file: Add `ignored_file.txt` to `.gitignore`
3. Ignore all files with a specific extension: Add `*.log` to `.gitignore`
4. Ignore a specific directory: Add `ignored_directory/` to `.gitignore`
5. Set up a global `.gitignore` file: `git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'`, then edit `~/.gitignore_global` with the desired patterns
