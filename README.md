**10 years old definition üë∂**:
- When you want Git to watch a new file or save the changes you made to a file, you have to add it to a special list. This list tells Git which files you want to save in your next project update.

**Definition üßë**:
- Adding files in Git means placing new or modified files into the staging area.This prepares the files to be included in the next commit. The `git add` command is used to add files to the staging area, effectively tracking the changes made to those files.

**PHD definition üéì**:
- In Git, adding files refers to the process of incorporating new or modified files into the staging area, which serves as an intermediary step prior to committing the changes to the repository. The `git add` command is employed to stage files, enabling the tracking of file changes and facilitating selective commits.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**:
1. Create a new file in your Git repository.
2. Add the file to the staging area.
3. Modify an existing file and add it to the staging area.

**References üìö**:
- [Git Basics - Recording Changes to the Repository (Ignoring Files section)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring)

**10 years old definition üë∂**:
- Sometimes you don't want Git to save certain files or folders. You can make a list of these files or folders in a special file called `.gitignore`, and Git will ignore them.

**Definition üßë**:
- Ignoring files in Git means excluding specific files or file patterns from being tracked by the version control system. This is achieved by listing the files or patterns in a `.gitignore` file. There can also be a global `.gitignore` file that applies to all Git repositories on the system.

**PHD definition üéì**:
- In Git, ignoring files entails the exclusion of designated files or file patterns from the purview of the version control system. This is achieved by enumerating the files or patterns within a `.gitignore` file, with the option to utilize a global `.gitignore` file that governs all Git repositories on a given system.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**:
1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository.
2. Ignore a specific file by adding its name to the `.gitignore` file.
3. Ignore all files with a specific extension by adding a pattern to the `.gitignore` file.
4. Ignore a specific directory by adding its path to the `.gitignore` file.
5. Set up a global `.gitignore` file that applies to all repositories on your system.

**Answers üëç**:

**10 years old definition üë∂**

- To combine the changes from two different copies of your code, use `git merge <branch_name>`.

**Definition üßë**

- Merging branches in Git is done with the `git merge <branch_name>` command. This command takes the changes from the specified branch and merges them into the current branch.

**PHD definition üéì**

- The `git merge <branch_name>` command integrates changes from the specified branch into the current branch, creating a new commit if the merge is non-fast-forward, or simply moving the branch pointer if the merge is fast-forward.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Create a new Git repository and initialize it.
2. Create a new branch called "feature-1".

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

**Important points üìå**

- Merge conflicts occur when the same part of a file is modified in both branches.
- Git marks the conflicting changes in the affected files.
- Conflicts must be resolved manually by editing the files and committing the changes.

**10 years old definition üë∂**

- Advanced branching strategies are like having different ways to organize your toys so that you can find and play with them easily.

**Definition üßë**

- Advanced branching strategies are specific workflows and guidelines for organizing and managing complex projects using Git branches.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Advanced branching strategies in Git are sets of methodologies and workflows designed to facilitate the organization and management of complex projects through the efficient use of branching and merging techniques, with a focus on promoting team collaboration, reducing conflicts, and maintaining a clear commit history.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Research and understand the Gitflow branching strategy.
2. Research and understand the GitHub Flow branching strategy.
3. Research and understand the GitLab Flow branching strategy.
4. Choose one of the strategies and apply it to a sample Git repository.
5. Observe how the chosen strategy helps manage the repository and improve collaboration.

**Answers üëç**

The practical exercises for this section involve researching and understanding different branching strategies. Therefore, there are no specific step-by-step answers for these exercises. However, here are some guidelines for each of the steps:

1-3. Read the provided references and other resources to gain a deeper understanding of the chosen branching strategies.

4. Apply the chosen strategy to a sample Git repository by creating branches, merging, and following the workflow specific to that strategy.

5. Reflect on how the chosen strategy helps manage the repository, reduces conflicts, and improves collaboration among team members.

**Basic examples üî∞**

In this section, we will provide a brief overview of the basic concepts behind the three main branching strategies: Gitflow, GitHub Flow, and GitLab Flow.

1. **Gitflow**

   - Two main branches: `main` (production-ready) and `develop` (latest development changes)
   - Feature branches: created from `develop` and merged back into `develop` when done
   - Release branches: created from `develop` to prepare for a new release
   - Hotfix branches: created from `main` for emergency fixes and merged back into both `main` and `develop`

2. **GitHub Flow**

   - One main branch: `main` (production-ready)
   - Feature branches: created from `main` and merged back into `main` when done, with a Pull Request
   - Continuous deployment: changes are deployed to production as soon as they are merged into `main`

3. **GitLab Flow**

   - One main branch: `main` (production-ready)
   - Feature branches: created from `main` and merged back into `main` with a Merge Request
   - Environment branches: branches for specific environments like staging, pre-production, or production
   - Release branches: optional, used for more complex projects

**Middle-ground examples ‚öñÔ∏è**

Since these are high-level branching strategies, there are no specific "middle-ground" examples. The examples provided in the "Basic examples" section should be sufficient for understanding the concepts behind the strategies.

**Advanced examples üöÄ**

Applying these branching strategies to real-world projects would be considered an advanced example. Select a project and choose a branching strategy that suits the needs of the project and the team. Implement the strategy and observe how it helps manage the project more efficiently.

- Git Large File Storage (LFS) is an extension for managing large files in Git repositories. It stores large files outside the repository and replaces them with text pointers, improving performance by reducing the repository size and decreasing clone and fetch times.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Git LFS is an open-source extension that provides a mechanism for efficiently storing and tracking large binary files within a Git repository. By storing large files outside the repository and replacing them with lightweight text pointers, LFS reduces repository size and improves performance, particularly for clone and fetch operations.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Install Git LFS on your system.
2. Initialize Git LFS for a specific repository.
3. Track a large file with Git LFS.
4. Untrack a large file with Git LFS.
5. Migrate an existing repository to Git LFS.

**Answers üëç**

1. Install Git LFS on your system with the appropriate command for your OS (e.g., `brew install git-lfs` on macOS).
2. Initialize Git LFS for a specific repository by navigating to the repository directory and running `git lfs install`.
3. Track a large file with Git LFS by running `git lfs track "<file-pattern>"`.
4. Untrack a large file with Git LFS by removing the file pattern from the `.gitattributes` file and running `git rm --cached <file-path>`.
5. Migrate an existing repository to Git LFS using `git lfs migrate import --include="<file-pattern>"`.

**Basic examples üî∞**

<--- ```bash --->
# Install Git LFS on macOS

- Git hooks are like little helpers that do something automatically when you use Git. For example, they can remind you to do your homework when you finish playing with your toys.

**Definition üßë**

- Git hooks are custom scripts that are triggered by specific Git events, such as committing or pushing. They can be used to enforce policies, automate tasks, or perform other actions based on the event.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Git hooks are customizable scripts that are automatically executed in response to specific Git events, such as pre-commit, post-commit, or pre-receive. These hooks enable developers to enforce policies, automate tasks, and implement custom workflows within a Git repository.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Create a pre-commit hook to check for syntax errors in your code.
2. Create a post-commit hook to notify team members of a new commit.
3. Create a pre-push hook to run unit tests before pushing to the remote repository.
4. Create a custom hook to enforce a specific commit message format.
5. Create a hook to prevent accidental pushes to the main branch.

**Answers üëç**

1. To create a pre-commit hook to check for syntax errors, create a file named `pre-commit` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that checks for syntax errors in the code and exits with a non-zero status if any are found.
2. To create a post-commit hook to notify team members of a new commit, create a file named `post-commit` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that sends notifications (e.g., email, chat messages) with the commit information to your team members.
3. To create a pre-push hook to run unit tests before pushing to the remote repository, create a file named `pre-push` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that runs the unit tests and exits with a non-zero status if any tests fail.
4. To create a custom hook to enforce a specific commit message format, create a file named `commit-msg` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that checks the commit message format and exits with a non-zero status if it does not match the desired format.
5. To create a hook to prevent accidental pushes to the main branch, create a file named `pre-push` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that checks the current branch and exits with a non-zero status if the branch is the main branch.

**Basic examples üî∞**

<--- ```bash --->
# Create a simple pre-commit hook
echo '#!/bin/sh' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo 'echo "Hello, World!"' >> .git/hooks/pre-commit

**10 years old definition üë∂**

- Git bisect is like a detective game that helps you find the exact moment when something went wrong in your code. It asks you questions to figure out which change caused the problem.

**Definition üßë**

- Git bisect is a tool for finding the commit that introduced a bug or a regression in your project. It uses a binary search algorithm to quickly narrow down the problematic commit by testing different commits between a known good and a known bad state.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Git bisect is a powerful debugging tool that leverages a binary search algorithm to efficiently identify the specific commit that introduced a regression or bug within a repository. By pinpointing the problematic commit, developers can isolate the root cause of the issue and apply appropriate fixes.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Identify the commit that introduced a bug using Git bisect.
2. Automate the bisect process using a script.
3. Use Git bisect to find a performance regression.
4. Use Git bisect to find a specific change in the output of a command.
5. Utilize Git bisect to identify a commit that broke a build.

**Answers üëç**

1. To identify the commit that introduced a bug using Git bisect, first mark the known good and bad commits with `git bisect start`, `git bisect bad <bad_commit>`, and `git bisect good <good_commit>`. Then, follow the bisect process by testing each commit suggested by Git bisect and marking it as good or bad until the problematic commit is found. Finally, use `git bisect reset` to return to the original state.
2. To automate the bisect process using a script, write a script that tests the commit for the bug and returns a zero exit status if the commit is good and a non-zero exit status if the commit is bad. Then, run `git bisect run <script>` to automate the bisect process.
3. To find a performance regression, modify the test script from step 2 to measure the performance of the code and return a zero exit status if the performance is acceptable and a non-zero exit status if the performance has regressed.
4. To find a specific change in the output of a command, modify the test script from step 2 to run the command and compare its output to the expected output. Return a zero exit status if the output matches and a non-zero exit status if the output differs.
5. To identify a commit that broke a build, modify the test script from step 2 to build the project and return a zero exit status if the build is successful and a non-zero exit status if the build fails.

**Basic examples üî∞**

### Reflog and Recovering Lost Commits

**Important points üìå**

- The reflog is a Git feature that records all updates to references (branches, tags, etc.).
- Reflog can be used to recover lost commits or to undo actions like a reset, rebase, or merge.
- The reflog is local to each repository, so it does not track changes in remote repositories.

- Reflog is like a secret diary that Git keeps, recording everything you do in your project. If you accidentally delete something or make a mistake, you can use the reflog to find what you did and fix it.

**Definition üßë**

- Git reflog is a feature that keeps track of all updates to references, such as branches and tags, in a local repository. It can be used to recover lost commits or undo actions like a reset, rebase, or merge.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Git reflog is a mechanism that logs all updates to references (branches, tags, and other refs) within a local repository. This enables developers to recover lost commits or revert actions, such as resets, rebases, and merges, by inspecting and manipulating the reflog's history.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Use the reflog to find a commit that was accidentally removed during a rebase.
2. Recover a branch that was accidentally deleted.
3. Undo a merge that caused conflicts.
4. Recover a commit that was removed during a force push.
5. Undo a commit that was amended by mistake.

**Answers üëç**

1. To find a commit that was accidentally removed during a rebase, run `git reflog` to view the reflog history. Identify the commit before the rebase started and use `git checkout` to create a new branch at that commit.
2. To recover a deleted branch, use `git reflog` to find the last commit on the branch. Then, create a new branch at that commit using `git checkout`.
3. To undo a merge that caused conflicts, use `git reflog` to find the commit before the merge. Then, use `git reset --hard` to reset the branch to that commit.
4. To recover a commit that was removed during a force push, use `git reflog` to find the commit before the force push. Then, create a new branch at that commit using `git checkout`.

5. To undo a commit that was amended by mistake, use `git reflog` to find the original commit before the amend. Then, create a new branch at that commit using `git checkout`.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Interactive rebase is an advanced Git operation that enables the modification of a sequence of commits through a variety of actions, such as reordering, squashing, editing, and splitting. This powerful feature facilitates cleaner and more comprehensible commit history, which is particularly beneficial prior to merging branches or pushing changes to a remote repository.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Use interactive rebase to squash multiple commits into a single commit.
2. Reorder commits using interactive rebase.
3. Edit a commit message using interactive rebase.
4. Split a commit into multiple commits using interactive rebase.
5. Use interactive rebase to remove a commit from the history.

**Answers üëç**

1. To squash multiple commits into a single commit, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the first commit you want to squash. In the interactive rebase editor, change the `pick` command to `squash` or `s` for all but the first commit in the series you want to squash. Save and exit the editor, then update the commit message when prompted.
2. To reorder commits using interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the first commit you want to reorder. In the interactive rebase editor, move the lines representing the commits to the desired order. Save and exit the editor.

3. To edit a commit message using interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the commit you want to edit. In the interactive rebase editor, change the `pick` command to `reword` or `r` for the commit you want to edit. Save and exit the editor, then update the commit message when prompted.

4. To split a commit into multiple commits using interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the commit you want to split. In the interactive rebase editor, change the `pick` command to `edit` or `e` for the commit you want to split. Save and exit the editor. Next, run `git reset HEAD^` to unstage the changes. Stage and commit the changes you want to split into separate commits, then run `git rebase --continue`.

5. To remove a commit from the history using interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the commit you want to remove. In the interactive rebase editor, delete the line representing the commit you want to remove. Save and exit the editor.

Versioning is like having different versions of your favorite toy, with each version having new features or improvements. Release management is making sure that each new version of the toy is tested and works well before giving it to other kids to play with.

**Definition üßë**
Versioning is the process of assigning unique identifiers to different versions of a software project, typically using a structured format like Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Release management is the process of preparing, testing, and deploying software releases, often using release branches, tagging, and CI/CD practices.

**PHD definition üéì**
Versioning and release management are crucial aspects of software development that facilitate the systematic tracking, testing, and deployment of software updates. Semantic Versioning, which employs a structured format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), enables developers to easily communicate the nature of changes introduced in a given release. Release management, which leverages release branches, tagging, changelogs, and CI/CD practices, streamlines the process of deploying stable software updates while minimizing disruptions to ongoing development.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**
1. Create a new release branch for a software project.
2. Tag a commit in a Git repository.
3. Write a changelog for a software project.
4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for a software project.
5. Update a project's version number following Semantic Versioning rules.

**Answers üëç**
1. To create a new release branch for a software project, use the following Git command: `git checkout -b release/x.y.z`
2. To tag a commit in a Git repository, use the following Git command: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"`
3. Writing a changelog involves documenting notable changes made between software versions, following a standard format such as [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
4. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a software project involves configuring a build system, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD, to automatically build, test, and deploy the software.
5. To update a project's version number following Semantic Versioning rules, increment the MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH version number depending on the nature of the changes introduced in the release.

5. Updating a project's version number following Semantic Versioning rules:
Before: version 1.1.0
After a minor update: version 1.2.0
After a patch update: version 1.2.1

**Middle-ground examples ‚öñÔ∏è**
<!--- ``` --->
1. Creating a new release branch and merging it into the master branch in Git:
git checkout -b release/1.3.0

Make changes, commit, and test
git checkout master
git merge release/1.3.0
git branch -d release/1.3.0
2. Tagging a commit and pushing the tag to a remote repository in Git:
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release 1.3.0"
git push origin v1.3.0
3. Writing a more detailed changelog with links to issues and commits:

4. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitLab CI/CD:
.gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
- build
- test
- deploy

build:
stage: build
script:
- npm install

test:
stage: test
script:
- npm test

deploy:
stage: deploy
script:
- 'which ssh-agent || (apt-get update -y && apt-get install openssh-client -y)'
- eval $(ssh-agent -s)
- echo "$PRIVATE_KEY" | tr -d '\r' | ssh-add - > /dev/null
- mkdir -p ~/.ssh
- '[[ -f /.dockerenv ]] && echo -e "Host *\n\tStrictHostKeyChecking no\n\n" > ~/.ssh/config'
- git remote add deploy "git@your-git-server.com:user/repo.git"
- git push deploy master
5. Updating a project's version number following Semantic Versioning rules and using Git tags:
Before: version 2.0.0 (tagged as v2.0.0)
After a major update: version 3.0.0
git tag -a v3.0.0 -m "Release 3.0.0"
git push origin v3.0.0

**Advanced examples üöÄ**
<!--- ``` --->
1. Creating a new release branch, merging it into the master branch, and tagging the merge commit in Git:
git checkout -b release/2.0.0

Make changes, commit, and test
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release/2.0.0
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release 2.0.0"
git branch -d release/2.0.0
git push origin master --tags

2. Tagging a specific commit in the Git history and pushing the tag to a remote repository:
git tag -a v1.4.0 abcdef1 -m "Release 1.4.0"
git push origin v1.4.0

3. Writing a changelog with links to compare different versions:
Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

1.4.0 - 2023-06-01
Changed
Improved feature X (#789, Commit)
Improved feature Y (#012, Commit)

4. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, using the Jenkinsfile to configure the pipeline:

// Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
agent any    
stages {
       stage('Build') {
           steps {
               sh 'npm install'
           }
       }
       stage('Test') {
           steps {
               sh 'npm test'
           }
       }
       stage('Deploy') {
           when {
               branch 'master'
           }
           steps {
               sshagent(credentials: ['your-ssh-credentials']) {
                   sh 'git remote add deploy "git@your-git-server.com:user/repo.git"'
                   sh 'git push deploy master'
               }
           }
       }
   }

   5. Using `npm version` to update a project's version number following Semantic Versioning rules and create a Git tag:
Before: version 1.4.0 (in package.json)
After a patch update: version 1.4.1
npm version patch -m "Release %s"
git push origin master --tags
