Git is like a special computer program that helps you save different versions of your school projects. You can go back and see what you changed or share your work with your friends easily. These special words help you remember what each part of Git does:

- Repository: A special box where your project lives.
- Commit: A picture of your project at a certain moment.
- Branch: A separate copy of your project where you can make changes.
- Merge: Bringing two copies of your project together.
- Clone: Making a new copy of your project on your computer.
- Fetch: Asking the computer to show you the latest changes.
- Pull: Getting the latest changes and adding them to your project.
- Push: Sending your changes to share with others.

**Definition üßë**:

- Repository: A storage location for a project, containing all the files, history, and branches.
- Commit: A set of changes made to a repository, creating a new snapshot in its history.
- Branch: An independent line of development within a repository, allowing for parallel changes.
- Merge: The process of integrating changes from one branch into another, combining their histories.
- Clone: Creating a local copy of a remote repository, including all its files, history, and branches.
- Fetch: Downloading changes from a remote repository without automatically merging them.
- Pull: Downloading and merging changes from a remote repository into the current branch.

**PHD definition üéì**:

- Repository: A data structure containing the entire history of a project, including file modifications, commits, and branches, typically implemented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- Commit: A vertex in the DAG representing an immutable snapshot of the repository at a specific point in its history, consisting of a set of changes, metadata, and parent commit(s).
- Branch: A mutable reference to a specific commit within a repository, serving as an abstraction for parallel development and isolation of changes.
- Merge: An operation that reconciles divergent branches by identifying a common ancestor, applying changes from each branch, and creating a new commit with multiple parents.
- Clone: The act of creating a local replica of a remote repository, including all its branches, commits, and associated metadata.
- Fetch: Obtaining updates from a remote repository and storing them in local references without modifying the working directory or merging changes.
- Pull: A combination of fetching updates from a remote repository and merging them into the current branch, updating the working directory.
- Push: Transmitting local commits and branch updates to a remote repository, synchronizing its state with the local repository.
