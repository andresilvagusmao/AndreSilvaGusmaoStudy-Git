- Commit: A vertex in the DAG representing an immutable snapshot of the repository at a specific point in its history, consisting of a set of changes, metadata, and parent commit(s).
- Branch: A mutable reference to a specific commit within a repository, serving as an abstraction for parallel development and isolation of changes.
- Merge: An operation that reconciles divergent branches by identifying a common ancestor, applying changes from each branch, and creating a new commit with multiple parents.
- Clone: The act of creating a local replica of a remote repository, including all its branches, commits, and associated metadata.
- Fetch: Obtaining updates from a remote repository and storing them in local references without modifying the working directory or merging changes.
- Pull: A combination of fetching updates from a remote repository and merging them into the current branch, updating the working directory.
- Push: Transmitting local commits and branch updates to a remote repository, synchronizing its state with the local repository.

**10 years old definition üë∂**:
- When you want Git to watch a new file or save the changes you made to a file, you have to add it to a special list. This list tells Git which files you want to save in your next project update.

**Definition üßë**:
- Adding files in Git means placing new or modified files into the staging area.This prepares the files to be included in the next commit. The `git add` command is used to add files to the staging area, effectively tracking the changes made to those files.

**PHD definition üéì**:
- In Git, adding files refers to the process of incorporating new or modified files into the staging area, which serves as an intermediary step prior to committing the changes to the repository. The `git add` command is employed to stage files, enabling the tracking of file changes and facilitating selective commits.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**:
1. Create a new file in your Git repository.
2. Add the file to the staging area.

**References üìö**:
- [Git Basics - Recording Changes to the Repository (Ignoring Files section)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring)

**10 years old definition üë∂**:
- Sometimes you don't want Git to save certain files or folders. You can make a list of these files or folders in a special file called `.gitignore`, and Git will ignore them.

**Definition üßë**:
- Ignoring files in Git means excluding specific files or file patterns from being tracked by the version control system. This is achieved by listing the files or patterns in a `.gitignore` file. There can also be a global `.gitignore` file that applies to all Git repositories on the system.

**PHD definition üéì**:
- In Git, ignoring files entails the exclusion of designated files or file patterns from the purview of the version control system. This is achieved by enumerating the files or patterns within a `.gitignore` file, with the option to utilize a global `.gitignore` file that governs all Git repositories on a given system.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**:
1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository.
2. Ignore a specific file by adding its name to the `.gitignore` file.
3. Ignore all files with a specific extension by adding a pattern to the `.gitignore` file.
4. Ignore a specific directory by adding its path to the `.gitignore` file.
5. Set up a global `.gitignore` file that applies to all repositories on your system.

**Answers üëç**:

**10 years old definition üë∂**

- To combine the changes from two different copies of your code, use `git merge <branch_name>`.

**Definition üßë**

- Merging branches in Git is done with the `git merge <branch_name>` command. This command takes the changes from the specified branch and merges them into the current branch.

**PHD definition üéì**

- The `git merge <branch_name>` command integrates changes from the specified branch into the current branch, creating a new commit if the merge is non-fast-forward, or simply moving the branch pointer if the merge is fast-forward.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

**Important points üìå**

- Merge conflicts occur when the same part of a file is modified in both branches.
- Git marks the conflicting changes in the affected files.
- Conflicts must be resolved manually by editing the files and committing the changes.

**10 years old definition üë∂**

- Advanced branching strategies are like having different ways to organize your toys so that you can find and play with them easily.

**Definition üßë**

- Advanced branching strategies are specific workflows and guidelines for organizing and managing complex projects using Git branches.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Advanced branching strategies in Git are sets of methodologies and workflows designed to facilitate the organization and management of complex projects through the efficient use of branching and merging techniques, with a focus on promoting team collaboration, reducing conflicts, and maintaining a clear commit history.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Research and understand the Gitflow branching strategy.
2. Research and understand the GitHub Flow branching strategy.
3. Research and understand the GitLab Flow branching strategy.
4. Choose one of the strategies and apply it to a sample Git repository.
5. Observe how the chosen strategy helps manage the repository and improve collaboration.

**Answers üëç**

The practical exercises for this section involve researching and understanding different branching strategies. Therefore, there are no specific step-by-step answers for these exercises. However, here are some guidelines for each of the steps:

1-3. Read the provided references and other resources to gain a deeper understanding of the chosen branching strategies.

4. Apply the chosen strategy to a sample Git repository by creating branches, merging, and following the workflow specific to that strategy.

5. Reflect on how the chosen strategy helps manage the repository, reduces conflicts, and improves collaboration among team members.

**Basic examples üî∞**

In this section, we will provide a brief overview of the basic concepts behind the three main branching strategies: Gitflow, GitHub Flow, and GitLab Flow.

1. **Gitflow**

   - Two main branches: `main` (production-ready) and `develop` (latest development changes)
   - Feature branches: created from `develop` and merged back into `develop` when done
   - Release branches: created from `develop` to prepare for a new release
   - Hotfix branches: created from `main` for emergency fixes and merged back into both `main` and `develop`

2. **GitHub Flow**

   - One main branch: `main` (production-ready)
   - Feature branches: created from `main` and merged back into `main` when done, with a Pull Request
   - Continuous deployment: changes are deployed to production as soon as they are merged into `main`

3. **GitLab Flow**

   - One main branch: `main` (production-ready)
   - Feature branches: created from `main` and merged back into `main` with a Merge Request
   - Environment branches: branches for specific environments like staging, pre-production, or production
   - Release branches: optional, used for more complex projects

**Middle-ground examples ‚öñÔ∏è**

Since these are high-level branching strategies, there are no specific "middle-ground" examples. The examples provided in the "Basic examples" section should be sufficient for understanding the concepts behind the strategies.

**Advanced examples üöÄ**

Applying these branching strategies to real-world projects would be considered an advanced example. Select a project and choose a branching strategy that suits the needs of the project and the team. Implement the strategy and observe how it helps manage the project more efficiently.

2. Clone the remote repository as the collaborator.
3. Make changes and push them to the remote repository as the collaborator.
4. Fetch and merge the collaborator's changes in the original repository.
5. Resolve any merge conflicts that occur.

**Answers üëç**

1. Add a collaborator to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab) through the repository's settings.
2. Clone the remote repository using the collaborator's account with `git clone <repository-url>`.
3. Make changes, stage, commit, and push them as the collaborator using `git add .`, `git commit -m "Message"`, and `git push`.
4. In the original repository, fetch and merge the collaborator's changes with `git fetch` and `git merge origin/branch-name`.
5. If merge conflicts occur, resolve them by editing the conflicting files, staging the changes, and committing the merge with `git add .` and `git commit -m "Merge message"`.

- Git Large File Storage (LFS) is an extension for managing large files in Git repositories. It stores large files outside the repository and replaces them with text pointers, improving performance by reducing the repository size and decreasing clone and fetch times.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Git LFS is an open-source extension that provides a mechanism for efficiently storing and tracking large binary files within a Git repository. By storing large files outside the repository and replacing them with lightweight text pointers, LFS reduces repository size and improves performance, particularly for clone and fetch operations.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Install Git LFS on your system.
2. Initialize Git LFS for a specific repository.
3. Track a large file with Git LFS.
4. Untrack a large file with Git LFS.
5. Migrate an existing repository to Git LFS.

**Answers üëç**

1. Install Git LFS on your system with the appropriate command for your OS (e.g., `brew install git-lfs` on macOS).
2. Initialize Git LFS for a specific repository by navigating to the repository directory and running `git lfs install`.
3. Track a large file with Git LFS by running `git lfs track "<file-pattern>"`.
4. Untrack a large file with Git LFS by removing the file pattern from the `.gitattributes` file and running `git rm --cached <file-path>`.
5. Migrate an existing repository to Git LFS using `git lfs migrate import --include="<file-pattern>"`.

**Basic examples üî∞**

<--- ```bash --->
# Install Git LFS on macOS

- Git hooks are like little helpers that do something automatically when you use Git. For example, they can remind you to do your homework when you finish playing with your toys.

**Definition üßë**

- Git hooks are custom scripts that are triggered by specific Git events, such as committing or pushing. They can be used to enforce policies, automate tasks, or perform other actions based on the event.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Git hooks are customizable scripts that are automatically executed in response to specific Git events, such as pre-commit, post-commit, or pre-receive. These hooks enable developers to enforce policies, automate tasks, and implement custom workflows within a Git repository.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Create a pre-commit hook to check for syntax errors in your code.
2. Create a post-commit hook to notify team members of a new commit.
3. Create a pre-push hook to run unit tests before pushing to the remote repository.
4. Create a custom hook to enforce a specific commit message format.
5. Create a hook to prevent accidental pushes to the main branch.

**Answers üëç**

1. To create a pre-commit hook to check for syntax errors, create a file named `pre-commit` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that checks for syntax errors in the code and exits with a non-zero status if any are found.
2. To create a post-commit hook to notify team members of a new commit, create a file named `post-commit` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that sends notifications (e.g., email, chat messages) with the commit information to your team members.
3. To create a pre-push hook to run unit tests before pushing to the remote repository, create a file named `pre-push` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that runs the unit tests and exits with a non-zero status if any tests fail.
4. To create a custom hook to enforce a specific commit message format, create a file named `commit-msg` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that checks the commit message format and exits with a non-zero status if it does not match the desired format.
5. To create a hook to prevent accidental pushes to the main branch, create a file named `pre-push` in the `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable. Write a script that checks the current branch and exits with a non-zero status if the branch is the main branch.

**Basic examples üî∞**

<--- ```bash --->
# Create a simple pre-commit hook
echo '#!/bin/sh' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo 'echo "Hello, World!"' >> .git/hooks/pre-commit

**10 years old definition üë∂**

- Git bisect is like a detective game that helps you find the exact moment when something went wrong in your code. It asks you questions to figure out which change caused the problem.

**Definition üßë**

- Git bisect is a tool for finding the commit that introduced a bug or a regression in your project. It uses a binary search algorithm to quickly narrow down the problematic commit by testing different commits between a known good and a known bad state.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Git bisect is a powerful debugging tool that leverages a binary search algorithm to efficiently identify the specific commit that introduced a regression or bug within a repository. By pinpointing the problematic commit, developers can isolate the root cause of the issue and apply appropriate fixes.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Identify the commit that introduced a bug using Git bisect.
2. Automate the bisect process using a script.
3. Use Git bisect to find a performance regression.
4. Use Git bisect to find a specific change in the output of a command.
5. Utilize Git bisect to identify a commit that broke a build.

**Answers üëç**

1. To identify the commit that introduced a bug using Git bisect, first mark the known good and bad commits with `git bisect start`, `git bisect bad <bad_commit>`, and `git bisect good <good_commit>`. Then, follow the bisect process by testing each commit suggested by Git bisect and marking it as good or bad until the problematic commit is found. Finally, use `git bisect reset` to return to the original state.
2. To automate the bisect process using a script, write a script that tests the commit for the bug and returns a zero exit status if the commit is good and a non-zero exit status if the commit is bad. Then, run `git bisect run <script>` to automate the bisect process.
3. To find a performance regression, modify the test script from step 2 to measure the performance of the code and return a zero exit status if the performance is acceptable and a non-zero exit status if the performance has regressed.
4. To find a specific change in the output of a command, modify the test script from step 2 to run the command and compare its output to the expected output. Return a zero exit status if the output matches and a non-zero exit status if the output differs.
5. To identify a commit that broke a build, modify the test script from step 2 to build the project and return a zero exit status if the build is successful and a non-zero exit status if the build fails.

**Basic examples üî∞**

# Start the bisect process
git bisect start
git bisect bad <bad_commit>
git bisect good <good_commit>

### Reflog and Recovering Lost Commits

**Important points üìå**

- The reflog is a Git feature that records all updates to references (branches, tags, etc.).
- Reflog can be used to recover lost commits or to undo actions like a reset, rebase, or merge.
- The reflog is local to each repository, so it does not track changes in remote repositories.

**Content table üìú**

- Reflog is like a secret diary that Git keeps, recording everything you do in your project. If you accidentally delete something or make a mistake, you can use the reflog to find what you did and fix it.

**Definition üßë**

- Git reflog is a feature that keeps track of all updates to references, such as branches and tags, in a local repository. It can be used to recover lost commits or undo actions like a reset, rebase, or merge.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Git reflog is a mechanism that logs all updates to references (branches, tags, and other refs) within a local repository. This enables developers to recover lost commits or revert actions, such as resets, rebases, and merges, by inspecting and manipulating the reflog's history.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Use the reflog to find a commit that was accidentally removed during a rebase.
2. Recover a branch that was accidentally deleted.
3. Undo a merge that caused conflicts.
4. Recover a commit that was removed during a force push.
5. Undo a commit that was amended by mistake.

**Answers üëç**

1. To find a commit that was accidentally removed during a rebase, run `git reflog` to view the reflog history. Identify the commit before the rebase started and use `git checkout` to create a new branch at that commit.
2. To recover a deleted branch, use `git reflog` to find the last commit on the branch. Then, create a new branch at that commit using `git checkout`.
3. To undo a merge that caused conflicts, use `git reflog` to find the commit before the merge. Then, use `git reset --hard` to reset the branch to that commit.
4. To recover a commit that was removed during a force push, use `git reflog` to find the commit before the force push. Then, create a new branch at that commit using `git checkout`.

5. To undo a commit that was amended by mistake, use `git reflog` to find the original commit before the amend. Then, create a new branch at that commit using `git checkout`.

- Interactive rebase is a Git feature that allows you to edit a series of commits by modifying, reordering, squashing, and splitting them. It is useful for cleaning up commit history before merging or pushing changes.

**PHD definition üéì**

- Interactive rebase is an advanced Git operation that enables the modification of a sequence of commits through a variety of actions, such as reordering, squashing, editing, and splitting. This powerful feature facilitates cleaner and more comprehensible commit history, which is particularly beneficial prior to merging branches or pushing changes to a remote repository.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**

1. Use interactive rebase to squash multiple commits into a single commit.
2. Reorder commits using interactive rebase.
3. Edit a commit message using interactive rebase.
4. Split a commit into multiple commits using interactive rebase.
5. Use interactive rebase to remove a commit from the history.

**Answers üëç**

1. To squash multiple commits into a single commit, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the first commit you want to squash. In the interactive rebase editor, change the `pick` command to `squash` or `s` for all but the first commit in the series you want to squash. Save and exit the editor, then update the commit message when prompted.
2. To reorder commits using interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the first commit you want to reorder. In the interactive rebase editor, move the lines representing the commits to the desired order. Save and exit the editor.

3. To edit a commit message using interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the commit you want to edit. In the interactive rebase editor, change the `pick` command to `reword` or `r` for the commit you want to edit. Save and exit the editor, then update the commit message when prompted.

4. To split a commit into multiple commits using interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the commit you want to split. In the interactive rebase editor, change the `pick` command to `edit` or `e` for the commit you want to split. Save and exit the editor. Next, run `git reset HEAD^` to unstage the changes. Stage and commit the changes you want to split into separate commits, then run `git rebase --continue`.

5. To remove a commit from the history using interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <commit>` where `<commit>` is the commit before the commit you want to remove. In the interactive rebase editor, delete the line representing the commit you want to remove. Save and exit the editor.

Git Flow is like a tree with branches. The tree trunk is the main part, and the branches are different parts of the project. We use this to work on the project without mixing everything up.

**Definition üßë**:
Git Flow is a branching model for Git that helps manage different versions of a project. It has two main branches (`master` and `develop`), and uses feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches to organize the work.

**PHD definition üéì**:
Git Flow is a comprehensive Git branching strategy that provides a structured approach to managing software releases and concurrent feature development. It employs a hierarchical branching model, incorporating main branches, feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches to facilitate parallel development, versioning, and release management.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**:
1. Initialize a Git repository and set up Git Flow.
2. Create a feature branch and implement a new feature.
3. Merge the feature branch into the `develop` branch.
4. Create a release branch and prepare for a new release.
5. Merge the release branch into the `master` branch and create a new tag.

**Answers üëç**:
1. `git init`, `git flow init`, and follow the prompts.
2. `git flow feature start <feature_name>`, implement the feature, and `git flow feature finish <feature_name>`.
3. The `git flow feature finish` command in step 2 will automatically merge the feature branch into the `develop` branch.
4. `git flow release start <version_number>`, prepare the release (update version numbers, etc.), and `git flow release finish <version_number>`.
5. The `git flow release finish` command in step 4 will automatically merge the release branch into the `master` branch, create a new tag, and merge back into the `develop` branch.

Versioning is giving numbers to different versions of a project. It helps people know what has changed and if the new version will work with what they have.

**Definition üßë**:
Versioning and release management practices involve using semantic versioning (major, minor, patch) to assign version numbers, separating development and release branches, using tags to mark releases, automating release management when possible, and maintaining a changelog to document changes between releases.

**PHD definition üéì**:
Versioning and release management encompass the systematic assignment of version numbers using semantic versioning principles, the separation of development and release branches to ensure stability, the use of tags to denote specific release points, the automation of release management processes to increase efficiency, and the maintenance of a comprehensive changelog to document changes between releases.

**Practical exercisesüèãÔ∏è**:
1. Create a versioning scheme for your project using semantic versioning.
2. Set up separate development and release branches in your repository.
3. Tag a release in your repository.
4. Implement an automated release management process.
5. Maintain a changelog for your project.

**Answers üëç**:
1. Choose a versioning scheme that follows the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:
   - MAJOR: Breaking changes
   - MINOR: New features that are backward-compatible
   - PATCH: Bug fixes and minor improvements
2. In your repository, create a `develop` branch for ongoing development and a `main` or `master` branch for stable releases.
3. To tag a release, use the following command:
   <!--- open code --->
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   <!--- close code --->
4. Implement an automated release management process using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions.
5. Create a `CHANGELOG.md` file in your repository and update it with every release, documenting the changes made in each version.
